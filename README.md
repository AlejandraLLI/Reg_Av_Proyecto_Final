# Reg_Av_Proyecto_Final

This repository contains the code and files for the project **"Analysis of the 2014-2016 Oil Crisis"** of the Advanced Regression (GLM) course. 

The objective is to provide an empirical explanation for the behavior of international oil prices during the oil crisis of 2014-2016 derived from different macroeconomic variables. To achieve this purpose an approach of generalized linear models with time series is used.

Note that all coding and comments are in Spanish. There is a pdf output for the project and a pdf output for the final presentation. Data was merged from different sources.
